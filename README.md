## Hardware description
1. Arduino Uno:
* Central controller for processing data from sensors and managing outputs.

2. Sensors:
* Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures the moisture level in the soil.
* DHT11/DHT22 Sensor: Measures air temperature and humidity.
* Photoresistor: Measures ambient light levels.

3. Output Devices:
* OLED Display (I2C interface): Displays real-time sensor readings (e.g., soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and light levels).
* Fan: Operates continuously to simulate airflow.
* LED Strip: Illuminates constantly for lighting purposes.
